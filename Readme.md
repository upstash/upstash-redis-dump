Dumps Redis keys & values to a file. Similar in spirit to https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-dump and https://github.com/delano/redis-dump but:

* Will dump keys across **several processes & connections**
* Uses SCAN rather than KEYS * for much **reduced memory footprint** with large databases
* Easy to deploy & containerize - **single binary**.
* Generates a [RESP](https://redis.io/topics/protocol) file rather than a JSON or a list of commands. This is **faster to ingest**, and [recommended by Redis](https://redis.io/topics/mass-insert) for mass-inserts.

## Features

* Dumps all databases present on the Redis server
* Keys TTL are preserved by default
* Configurable Output (Redis commands, RESP)
* Redis password-authentication
> [!NOTE]  
> This tool does not dump Redis Stream entries.


## Installation

You can download one of the pre-built binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS from the 
[releases](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump/releases/latest) page.

```bash
go install github.com/upstash/upstash-redis-dump@latest
```

  -batchSize int
        HSET/RPUSH/SADD/ZADD only add 'batchSize' items at a time (default 1000)
  -cacert string

  -cert string
        TLS Cert file path
  -db uint
        only dump this database (default: all databases)

  -key string
        TLS Key file path
  -n int
        Parallel workers (default 10)
  -noscan
        Use KEYS * instead of SCAN - for Redis <=2.8
  -output string
        Output type - can be resp or commands (default "resp")
  -pass string
        Server password

## Sample Export 

```bash
$ upstash-redis-dump -db 0 -host eu1-moving-loon-6379.upstash.io -port 6379 -pass PASSWORD -tls > redis.dump
Database 0: 9 keys dumped
```

## Importing the data

```
redis-cli --tls -u redis://REDIS_PASSWORD@gusc1-cosmic-heron-6379.upstash.io:6379 --pipe < redis.dump
```
